# PepesChoice_TeamNameGenerator

Developed and executed on Macbook/Bash shell, May 2016. 

The text files need to be in the same folder as the .py file; 
editing the path within the .py is also an option.

Taking it further: 
- Developing a simple GUI
- Developing a simple iOS app
- Integrating w/ Raspberry PI server
- Integrating w/ Arduino & push-button controls; LCD display?

Enjoy ^_^
