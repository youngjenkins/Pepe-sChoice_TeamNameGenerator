Look, I named it before I found out that Pepe had become a byword for shitty racists. 

Developed and executed on Macbook/Bash shell, May 2016. 

Description: 
  This is a small generator that will create a sportball team name from a city + a meme.

File List:
  cities.txt
  memes.txt
  memeDreamTeams.py

Notes for Running:
  The text files need to be in the same folder as the .py file; 
  else editing the path in the calls to open the files within the .py is also an option.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
February 2017: 
  memeTeams_all-in-one.py
  Removed need for external files, replaced with two sets within the .py file.

Taking it further: 
- Developing a simple GUI
- Developing a simple iOS app
- Integrating w/ Raspberry PI server
- Integrating w/ Arduino: push-button controls & LCD display

Enjoy ^_^
